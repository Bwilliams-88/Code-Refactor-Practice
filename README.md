# HTML and CSS Code Refactor

## This project was a challenge for me learning semantic HTML because in my previous education I do not recall ever having to use them. I feel like I learned quite a bit using semantic tags like <section> <article> and <aside>, I also learned how to consolidate CSS to cut back on repetitive code that can all be tied to multiple selectors.
